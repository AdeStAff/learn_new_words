# Vidya

**Vidya** is a vocabulary app I created to help learn new words in both French and English. Whenever I come across a word or expression I want to remember, I simply send it to *Vidya* on WhatsApp, and it responds with the definition while saving it automatically to my vocabulary database on Google Sheets.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Send a Message**: The user sends a message to *Vidya*, starting with "vocab" followed by the language code ("en" for English, "fr" for French).
2. **Fetch Definition**: *Vidya* fetches the word or expression's definition.
3. **Receive Response**: It sends the definition back via WhatsApp.
4. **Save to Database**: The word or expression, along with its definition, is saved to the vocabulary database.

## Where Do the Definitions Come From?

- **English**: Merriam-Webster, a leading authority in American English.
- **French**: Le Robert (coming soon).

## Next Steps

- **Add Translation Capabilities**:
    - French ↔ English
    - French ↔ Russian
- **Add Quote Integration**: Allow users to save example quotes for words in the database.
